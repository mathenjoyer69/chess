# chess
my first time doing ts(this)
add the assets folder in the same "place" as the code
the code creates a chess board with all the pieces. white starts and when its black's turn if you click "space" my amazing non working bot will give you his top choice
DO NOT SET THE DEPTH MORE THAN 4 IT WILL CRASH
